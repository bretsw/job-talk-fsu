# Networked learning

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}

```

**Definition:** 

--

- The learning supported by the novel social and environmental conditions created by the internet.

- Especially *informal*, *self-directed*, and *just-in-time* (i.e., as needed) learning.

---

# Networked learning

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}

--

- This often occurs *informally*, in a *self-organized* way

--

- May not resemble a traditional, offline community (e.g., local neighborhood, civic organization)

My research investigates networked learning

addressing both possibilities and perils

by employing numerous <span style="color:yellow">**learning analytics**</span> techniques.

---

#  Digital traces

```{r, out.width = "420px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/purpose.jpg")
```

--

To understand the complexities of networked learning: 

--

- I study **digital traces** of activity and behavior in online communities. 

--

  - **Definition:** residual, observable evidence of online activity

--

  - **Examples:** tweets, forum posts, user profiles

--

  - **Collection:** through techniques shared with educational data mining

---

#  Digital traces

```{r, out.width = "420px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/purpose.jpg")
```

--

- I am able to unobtrusively gather real-world, *in situ* data

--

- These *digital traces* complement traditional *self-report* methods (reducing bias)

---

# Learning analytics

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/code.jpg")
```

--

**Learning analytics** techniques have allowed me to:

--

- Handle massive quantities of data

--

- Identify patterns and trends in messy datasets of digital traces

--

-	Infer possibilities and perils

---

# Flexible tools

```{r, out.width = "300px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/R-logo.png")
```

--

Large datasets do not open in Excel, so I learned **R**

--

- R is a programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics

--

- R has numerous *packages* useful for learning analytics:

--

  - **ggplot2** for data visualization
  
--
  
  - **igraph** for social network analysis
  
--
  
  - **caret** for machine learning

---

# New tools

```{r, out.width = "420px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/package.png")
```

--

Sometimes, the tools I need don't exist yet.

--

- e.g., collecting tweets over time, processing Twitter data, and systematically analyze with a learning analytics perspective

--


  - I wanted to this Twitter data collection and analysis workflow easier for others 

--

  - so I built an R software package: **tidytags**: https://bretsw.github.io/tidytags/

**Question:** How and why do teachers use Twitter?

--

**Platform:** Twitter

--

**Community:** \#Edchat hashtag

---

# 1. Twitter communities

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/twitter-purposes.png")
```

--

**Data collection:** 1,228,506 \#Edchat tweets

--

**Data analysis:** 

--

- Classification of tweet types

--

- Discourse analysis 

---

# Tweet example

```{r, out.width = "540px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/tweet-example.png")
```

---

# Twitter hashtags

```{r, out.width = "300px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/hashtag.jpg")
```

--

**Many different uses of Twitter hashtags:**

--

- Topical index: #Teaching

--

- Humor and wit: #CoolTeacher

--

- Synchronous chats: #SatChat

--

- "Space" for ongoing discussions: #ITeachMath

---

# \#Edchat background

```{r, out.width = "300px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/hashtag.jpg")
```

--

- \#Edchat is one of the oldest and busiest educational Twitter hashtags

--

- \#Edchat is self-described as:

> "...Twitter discussion that any educator can discuss and learn about current teaching trends, to integrate technology, to transform their education, and to connect with inspiring instructors around the world."

### Machine learning classifier

In <i>AoIR selected papers of internet research</i>. Association of Internet Researchers. https://spir.aoir.org/ojs/index.php/spir/article/view/10512
</p>

<hr>

--

**Goal:** Automatically detect tweet purposes through a *logistic regression classifier*

--

- Identified 39 tweet features to build the classifier

--

- Compared efficacy of 10 different ML methods (e.g., random forest, *k*-nearest neighbors)

---

# 1. Twitter communities

```{r, out.width = "420px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/twitter-purposes.png")
```

### Possibilities

--

- Huge amount of on-topic educational content (i.e., approximately 5,000 daily \#Edchat tweets)

--
  
- High engagement (e.g., retweeting others' content)

--

- Informal online learning environment likely holds implications for formal teaching and learning

---

# 1. Twitter communities

```{r, out.width = "420px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/twitter-purposes.png")
```

### Perils

--

- Imbalance of needs being supported (e.g., nearly half of new \#Edchat content is self-promotional in nature)

--

- Volume of content is likely overwhelming for new Twitter users or new teachers

--

- Volume (and noise) of content is likely overwhelming for researchers
